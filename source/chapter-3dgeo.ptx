      <title>The 3D Cartesian Coordinate System</title>
      <p>Imagine you're a drone pilot tasked with navigating your drone to take aerial photographs of a cityscape. 
        Suppose you need the drone to start from a point close to the ground, ascend to capture an aerial shot of a skyscraper, 
        and then move horizontally to take photos of the cityscape. How would you account for these various movements in terms of coordinates?</p>
      <p>When you walk on flat ground, you only need to think about moving forward, backward, left, and right. 
        This is a two-dimensional movement: every location on your path can be pinpointed using just two coordinates. 
        But when you're flying a drone, you also need to account for the altitude—how high or low the drone is. 
        Suddenly, you're not just moving in a flat plane; you're moving in space! This movement adds a third dimension to your coordinates.</p>

        <title>3D Coordinates</title>
        <p>You may recall the 2D Cartesian coordinate system—a flat plane where any point can be located using two coordinates, x (horizontal) and y (vertical). 
            When we introduce a third axis to account for the 'depth' or 'height' in space, we enter the realm of 3D geometry. 
            The third axis, called the z-axis, stands perpendicular to the 2D plane formed by the x and y axes.
            If you imagine the x-axis as running left-to-right and the y-axis running forward-and-backward, the z-axis would run up-and-down.</p>
           
        <p>Any point in this three-dimensional space is represented by an ordered triple of coordinates <m>(x,y,z)</m>. 
            The x-coordinate still tells you how far left or right the point is, the y-coordinate tells you how far forward or backward, 
            and the new z-coordinate tells you how far up or down.</p>

            Play with the sliders to move the point in 3D, and drag around to change perspective. You'll be using math3d.org a lot this semester, so feel free to play around with it!</p>
